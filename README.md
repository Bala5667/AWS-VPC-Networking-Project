# AWS-VPC-Networking-Project

Key Objectives of the project:
â€¢	Created a VPC with CIDR block 10.0.0.0/16.
â€¢	Provisioned Subnets:
â€¢	Public Subnet: 10.0.1.0/24 (For internet-facing resources).
â€¢	Private Subnet: 10.0.2.0/24 (For internal workloads).
â€¢	Configured an Internet Gateway (IGW) to allow public instances to access the internet.
â€¢	Set up a NAT Gateway to enable outbound internet access for private instances while keeping them secure.

Created Route Tables:
â€¢	Public Route Table â†’ Routes traffic through IGW.
â€¢	Private Route Table â†’ Routes traffic through NAT Gateway.
â€¢	Launched EC2 instances in both public and private subnets:
â€¢	Public EC2 Instance: Assigned a public IP and configured for direct internet access.
â€¢	Private EC2 Instance: No public IP, accesses the internet via NAT Gateway.

Configured Security Groups to allow appropriate inbound and outbound traffic.
Verified Network Connectivity:
â€¢	Successfully SSHâ€™d into the Public EC2 Instance.
â€¢	Accessed the Private EC2 Instance via the Public EC2.
â€¢	Tested outbound internet access from the Private EC2 via NAT Gateway


Steps to achive the objectives :

Step 1: Creating the VPC :

I navigated to AWS Management Console â†’ VPC â†’ Your VPCs.
Clicked Create VPC and provided the following details:
VPC Name: My-VPC
IPv4 CIDR Block: 10.0.0.0/16 (to get 65,536 IPs).
Clicked Create VPC.

Step 2: Creating and Attaching an Internet Gateway
Went to VPC â†’ Internet Gateways.
Clicked Create Internet Gateway, named it My-IGW, and created it.
Attached it to My-VPC by selecting it and clicking Attach to VPC.

Step 3: Creating Public and Private Subnets
Public Subnet:
Name: Public-Subnet
VPC: My-VPC
CIDR Block: 10.0.1.0/24
Availability Zone: us-east-1a
Private Subnet:
Name: Private-Subnet
VPC: My-VPC
CIDR Block: 10.0.2.0/24
Availability Zone: us-east-1a

Step 4: Creating and Configuring Route Tables

Public Route Table
Created a new Route Table named Public-RT and associated it with My-VPC.
Attached Public-Subnet to Public-RT.
Added a route to the internet:
Destination: 0.0.0.0/0
Target: My-IGW

Private Route Table
Created another Route Table named Private-RT and associated it with My-VPC.
Attached Private-Subnet to Private-RT.

Step 5: Creating Security Groups
Public Security Group (Public-SG)
Allowed:
SSH (22) from My IP
HTTP (80), HTTPS (443) from anywhere
RDP (3389) if needed for Windows

Private Security Group (Private-SG)
Allowed only traffic from Public-SG, including:
SSH (22) from Public-SG
Other required ports if needed

Step 6: Launching EC2 Instances

Public EC2
VPC: My-VPC
Subnet: Public-Subnet
Auto-assign Public IP: Enabled
Security Group: Public-SG
Key Pair: Used existing my-key.pem

Private EC2
VPC: My-VPC
Subnet: Private-Subnet
Auto-assign Public IP: Disabled
Security Group: Private-SG

Step 7: Creating and Configuring NAT Gateway
Created a NAT Gateway in Public-Subnet and attached a new Elastic IP.
Updated Private-RT to allow internet access via NAT Gateway:
Destination: 0.0.0.0/0
Target: My-NAT-Gateway

Step 8: Testing Internet Connectivity
Checking Public EC2 Connectivity
SSH into Public EC2
ssh -i "my-key.pem" ec2-user@<Public-EC2-Public-IP>
Verified internet access
Command :
curl ifconfig.me
ping -c 4 google.com

Step : Checking Private EC2 Connectivity:

Now, you can SSH into your Private EC2 instance from your Public EC2.
In your Public EC2 instance terminal, run:
ssh -i my-key.ppk ec2-user@<Private-EC2-Private-IP>

On Windows, transfer the my-key.pem file to the Public EC2 using WinSCP or PSCP.
Set Correct Permissions On the Public EC2, run:
chmod 400 my-key.pem

Connected to Private EC2 via Public EC2
Command :
ssh -i "my-key.pem" ec2-user@<Private-EC2-Private-IP>

Checked internet access via NAT Gateway :
curl ifconfig.me
ping -c 4 google.com
The output matched the NAT Gatewayâ€™s Elastic IP, confirming that the private instance accesses the internet via NAT.

Final Thoughts
âœ… VPC with Public and Private Subnets successfully set up.
âœ… Public EC2 connected to the internet directly.
âœ… Private EC2 accessed the internet via NAT Gateway while remaining secure.
âœ… Successfully tested connectivity from both instances.

This setup follows best practices for networking in AWS and provides a secure and scalable architecture. ðŸš€
